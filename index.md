# SPOCK v2 Documentation üññ	

*SPOCK* (Speculoos Observatories sChedule maKer) is a python package
developed to handle the planification of observation of the SPECULOOS
telescopes. The project SPECULOOS -Search for habitable Planets
EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars -- searches for potentially habitable
exoplanets around the smallest and coolest stars of the solar
neighborhood [Link to
site](https://www.speculoos.uliege.be/cms/c_4259452/fr/speculoos).

üìù The strategy of the SPECULOOS survey and how it is implemented in SPOCK is described in [Sebastian et al. 2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/01/aa38827-20/aa38827-20.html). You can find more details in [How SPOCK works](https://educrot22.github.io/SPOCK_v2/examples/ressources/how).

üõ†Ô∏è üìà SPOCK contains many useful functions and helpful plots, check [SPOCK tools](https://educrot22.github.io/SPOCK_v2/examples/tutorials/notebooks/tutorials_spocktools) and [SPOCK plots](https://educrot22.github.io/SPOCK_v2/examples/tutorials/notebooks/tutorials_spockplot) for more details.


üß© To make it more convenient for users, we have also created a GUI-like interface called SPOCKApp that gathers all SPOCK‚Äôs functionality with widgets. Check the tab [SPOCKApp](https://educrot22.github.io/SPOCK_v2/examples/tutorials/notebooks/tutorials_SPOCKApp) for more info.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only members of the SPECULOOS consortium can use SPOCK. In particular, the two persons in charge of the scheduling are [Elsa Ducrot](elsa.ducrot@cea.fr) and [Mathilde Timmermans](mathilde.timmermans@uliege.be).
